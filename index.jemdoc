== Short Bio 
I'm a PhD student in the School of Computing Science at Simon Fraser University, supervised by [https://sfumars.com/mo-chen/ Prof. Mo Chen]. Previously, I received 
  a M.Eng degree from Beihang University and a B.Eng degree from Northeast University at QinhuangDao (China). My current research 
  centers around reinforcement learning, optimal control, and their combinational use on robot learning problems. I have worked for 
  [https://www.linkedin.com/company/huawei-technologies-canada-co-ltd/?originalSubdomain=ca Huawei Canada Research] and 
  [https://www.linkedin.com/company/horizonrobotics/ Horizon Robotics] to develop algorithms and tools for robot systems. \n
  In my spare time, I like playing basketball, developing software for embedded systems, and keeping track of the advances in the rocket industry.
  I'm also a fan of detective fiction. Ellery Queen and Arthur Conan Doyle are two of my favorite authors.
